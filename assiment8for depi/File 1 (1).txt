1. Data Profiling:
   Generate summary statistics for the TransactionAmount column to identify anomalies or outliers in the dataset.

2. Comparison with Original Data:
   Compare the number of rows in the original dataset with the cleaned dataset. Ensure no rows were lost during the cleaning process.

3. Validation Rules:
   - Verify that all email addresses in the cleaned dataset contain an "@" symbol and have no invalid entries.
   - Check that all TransactionAmounts are non-negative and that missing values have been appropriately replaced.

4. Consistency Checks:
   Validate that transactions occurring on the same TransactionDate do not have duplicate TransactionIDs.

5. Cross-Table Validation (Simulated):
   Assume you have a secondary dataset called customer_profiles with columns CustomerName and CustomerID. Write SQL queries to:
   - Identify transactions in the cleaned dataset with CustomerName values that do not exist in customer_profiles.
   - Join the two tables to verify that each transaction has a valid customer reference.

6. Null Value Check:
   Write a query to ensure there are no NULL values in any columns of the cleaned dataset.

7. Impact of Cleaning:
   Generate a report comparing:
   - The count of missing values in the original and cleaned datasets for each column.
   - The number of duplicate entries in the original and cleaned datasets.
